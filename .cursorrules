make sure to resolve "declared but never used" typescript/variable-name errors

whenever there is an error, Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem, distill those down to 1-2 most likely sources, and then add logs to validate your assumptions before we move onto implementing the actual code fix

just use vanilla css, no fancy libraries like tailwind

Ensure TypeScript types are complete
rule TypeScriptPropertyCheck {
  when {
    // Check for property access on types
    matches_any {
      typescript_error("Property '${property}' does not exist on type")
    }
  }
  suggest {
    // Suggest adding the missing property to the interface/type
    "Add the '${property}' property to the corresponding interface/type definition"
  }
}
